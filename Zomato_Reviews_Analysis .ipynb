    "**Zomato is India's largest platform for discovering restaurants and \n",
    "ordering food. It operates in India as well as a few cities internationally. Bangalore is one of the biggest customer and restaurant bases for zomato with 4 to 5 million users using the platform each month.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Users on the platform can also post reviews of restaurants, and provide a rating accomapnying the review. The content in the reviews should ideally reflect the rating provided by the customer. In many cases, there is a mismatch, owning to multiple reasons where the rating does not match the customer review. The reviews and ratings matching is very important as it builds customer trust on the platform, and helps the user get an accurate picture of the restaurant.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**You, as a data scientist, need to enable the identification and cleanup of such cases, to ensure the ratings are reflective of the reviews and that the reviews seem trustworthy to the custimer. You will need to use NLP techniques in conjunction with Machine learning models to predict the rating from the review text.**\n",

    "Tokenization is the first step in any NLP pipeline. It has an important effect on the rest of our pipeline.

The token occurrences in a document can be used directly as a vector representing that document. \n",

    "This immediately turns an unstructured string (text document) into a numerical data structure suitable for machine learning. They can also be used directly by a computer to trigger useful actions and responses. Or they might be used in a machine learning pipeline as features that trigger more complex decisions or behavior.\n",

And despite the fact that it doesn't look like a proper English sentence, we'd likely understand the meaning if you heard it somewhere. That's why in many cases we can make our models simpler by simply ignoring these words. Stop words are usually the most common words in natural texts. \n",

    "* Full form of TF is term frequency. It is the count of word “x” in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Full form of IDF is inverse document frequency. Document frequency is the number of documents which contain the word “x”. \n",
    "Natural language processing (NLP) uses tf-idf technique to convert text documents to a machine understandable form. Each sentence is a document and words in the sentence are tokens. Tfidf vectorizer creates a matrix with documents and token scores therefore it is also known as document term matrix (dtm).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vectorization**: tfidfVectorizer performs this task by first creating an array where each value represents a word in your training data set and its corresponding weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand tf-idf, let’s take a look at the following example. A document is made up of words, each word is assigned a weight from 1 to 100 (where 1 is the most important and 100 means it has no importance in that particular context). Given this information, TfidfVectorizer will output a vector for each document in which the values correspond to these weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorization: tfidfVectorizer performs this task by first creating an array where each value represents a word in your training data set and its corresponding weight.*\n",
    "What we get after applying TfidfVectorizer is a matrix of dimensions (2397, 75889).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the magic happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have applied TfidfVectorizer to your corpus, what you get is a sparse matrix of dimensions (2397, 75889). This means that there are only non-zero values in this matrix. The first dimension represents the document IDs and second dimension represents our words or terms in the corpus. Each row of this matrix contains information about how often was a given word used across all documents in our corpus along with TFIDF value for that term/word (float).\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically we can say TfidfVectorizer has turned our text data into numerical form so that it can be used by other ML algorithms such as LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have 2397 documents and 75889 different words in our corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sklearn library uses a sparse matrix format for storing this matrix which means that it only stores the non-zero values and indices. This makes the process of loading and saving the model extremely fast as well as saves memory space. The sparse format also allows us to use less memory when dealing with large datasets."

    "Random Forest is an ensemble technique capable of performing both regression and classification tasks with the use of multiple decision trees and a technique called Bootstrap and Aggregation, commonly known as bagging. The basic idea behind this is to combine multiple decision trees in determining the final output rather than relying on individual decision trees. "
